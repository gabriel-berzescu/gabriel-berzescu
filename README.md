# Hi, I'm Gabriel Berzescu 👋

## AI Expert & Educator

I help people and companies integrate artificial intelligence into their work processes and transform AI from an abstract tool into a real collaborative partner.

### Background

Working with AI since 2019 (from GPT-2 to the latest models). Started with Andrew Ng's Machine Learning and Deep Learning courses on Coursera, then immediately applied what I learned by automating customer support using fine-tuned GPT-2 for WordPress plugins.

- 2020: Data Scientist at an online pharma retailer
- 2022-present: Integrating AI into workflows at Sustainalytics
- 2025: Teaching AI course at IT School

### What I Do

- **AI Consulting**: Integrating AI into business processes and developing long-term strategies
- **Corporate Training**: Intensive sessions for teams - from AI fundamentals to advanced techniques
- **Workshops & Coaching**: Practical sessions for professionals looking to use AI effectively
- **Speaking**: Presentations at conferences on AI integration and human-AI collaboration

### Philosophy

I believe in AI as a thinking partner, not just a tool. I work with people and companies to build authentic collaboration between human and artificial intelligence - a partnership where both sides complement and amplify each other.
